## Project Description
For this project, we built a secure microservice using Node.js, which serves as the core component for managing the product catalog of an e-commerce platform. We implemented fundamental DevOps practices throughout the development lifecycle, hosting our code on a public repository on GitHub. Utilizing CI/CD pipelines, we automated the build and deployment processes of the microservice. To ensure portability and scalability, we containerized the microservice using Docker and hosted the container image on an existing container registry service. For deployment, we leveraged AWS as our cloud service provider, utilizing managed container orchestration services such as Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service) to deploy the containerized microservice, making it accessible over the internet. Security was a paramount consideration throughout the development process. We integrated managed SAST tools like SonarCloud to enforce security best practices and conducted thorough testing to ensure the microservice handles data securely and follows the principles of least privilege.
